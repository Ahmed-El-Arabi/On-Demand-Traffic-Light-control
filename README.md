# Project: On-demand Traffic light control
This is an Embedded Systems project provided by EgFWD Nanodegree program. Embedded C was the coding language and it was simulated on SimulIDE.

## System description

Traffic lights are signaling devices positioned at road intersections, pedestrian crossings, and other locations to control the flow of traffic.


Traffic lights normally consist of three signals, transmitting meaning to drivers and riders through colors and symbols including arrows and bicycles.

The regular traffic light colors are red, yellow, and green arranged vertically or horizontally in that order.

Although this is internationally standardized, variations exist on national and local scales as to traffic light sequences and laws.

There are two operating modes for this project to emulate reality, Normal mode and Pedestrian mode.

**Normal** Mode the car lights switch from green to blinking yellow to red then blinking yellow then green again and the loop goes on.

**Pedestrian** mode is activated when an interrupt is called (Which is represented by a button) depending on the current car traffic car light active, the system will commence accordingly wether it's green & yellow or red.
